# pad2drums
Converting raw sound from hitting pads to drum sound


Function pad2drums (the main function)
Reads .wav-file in folder "raw_audio" from a drum pad (with mic about 10 cm away)
and converts it to an .wav-file with drum sounds in place of 
the pad sounds. Created file is placed in folder "results".

Note that the folder drum_samples (with bass_drum.wav, snare_drum.wav and hi_hat.wav in it) are not provided
and might be added later. Need to record my own samples due to copyrights.
